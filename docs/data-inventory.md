# Federal Carbon Footprint Data Inventory

This document is a work-in-progress data inventory for understanding the federal government's carbon footprint.

## Reporting guidance

[The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf)

Council on Environmental Quality: [Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Reporting Guidance](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/federal_ghg%20accounting_reporting-guidance.pdf)

## Emission types

### Scope 1

Direct emission; eg burning fuel

### Scope 2

Indirect emissions, financially responsibility; eg electricity
### Scope 3

[Scope 3 Calculation Guidance](https://ghgprotocol.org/scope-3-technical-calculation-guidance)

## Data Sources

Documented here are data sources and models that have been identified as potentially useful for understanding the GHG impact of federal activity.

### Federal Energy Management Program

### Federal Procurement Data System

[https://www.fpds.gov/](https://www.fpds.gov/)

Purchasing data; FPDS is the system of record for usaspending.gov.

### usaspending.gov

[https://www.usaspending.gov/](https://www.usaspending.gov/)

Provides a user-friendly view into spending data, as well as an API. FPDS is the system of record for usaspending.gov.

### System for Award Management (SAM)

Some of the FPDS reports (above) have been migrated to [https://sam.gov/](https://sam.gov/).

Assistance Listings (CFDA) on sam.gov are federal programs that issue grants and other forms of assistance.

### US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) Model

[EPA USEEIO](https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models) was developed as part of EPA's [Sustainable Materials Management Program](https://www.epa.gov/smm).

The [SMM Prioritization Tools](https://www.epa.gov/smm/sustainable-materials-management-prioritization-tools) utilize USEEIO to visualize environmental impact for specified [NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/) sectors.

### Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA)

Carnegie Mellon hosts an online tool to estimate emissions impact using the EIO-LCA method: [http://www.eiolca.net/](http://www.eiolca.net/)

Given an [NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/) sector ID, various impacts (including greenhouse gas emissions) may be estimated per unit of economic activity.

### EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)

https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting

Mandatory emissions reporting for large-scale private sector emissions, grouped by these sectors:

- Electrical Equipment
- Electronics Manufacturing
- Fluorinated Chemicals
- Metals
- Minerals
- Miscellaneous Combustion
- Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
- Non-Fluorinated Chemicals
- Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems
- Petroleum Products
- Power Plants
- Pulp and Paper
- selected="">Refineries
- Underground Coal Mines
- Waste

## Ecolabel programs

Labelling programs don't give direct insight into emission impact, but could be integrated into an exploratory tool to suggest green products within given categories.

### Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)

EPEAT may be relevant when shedding light on scope 3 emissions from product purchases.

https://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts/electronic-product-environmental-assessment-tool-epeat

EPEAT covers the following product categories:

Computers & Displays
Imaging Equipment
Mobile Phones
Photovoltaic Modules and Inverters (PVMI)
Televisions
Servers

### Energy Star

Energy efficient product label.

### SmartWay

EPAâ€™s SmartWay program helps companies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, benchmarking, and improving freight transportation efficiency.
