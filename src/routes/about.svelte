    <h1>Visualizing the Federal Carbon Footprint</h1>
    <p>
      Funded by <a href="https://10x.gsa.gov/">10x</a>, this repository is home to the
      <a href="https://trello.com/c/1N9dESH2/162-visualizing-the-federal-carbon-footprint">
        Visualizing the Federal Carbon Footprint
      </a> project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently in <a href="https://10x.gsa.gov/process/">phase two (discovery)</a>, we are focused
      on exploring this idea:
    </p>
    <p>
      We have observed that the federal government emits huge amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG)
      every year, including more than 37 million tons from federal facility operations in 2019
      alone. The public lacks a window into how federal agencies are doing their part to reduce the
      effects of climate change. 10x will investigate how user-centered design and savvy data
      analysis could create a clear picture of the governmentâ€™s efforts to kick its carbon habit,
      resulting in more transparency and accountability and ensuring that we, as civil servants, are
      doing our best to reduce the impact of climate change on our country.
