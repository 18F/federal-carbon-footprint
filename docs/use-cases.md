# Potential Project Use-cases

This document outlines a high-level overview of use-case areas.

Generally speaking, all potential use-cases of a visualization tool are focussed on improving the accessibility of the underlying data.

## Big picture

Help people understand the big picture of federal emissions, by combining multiple federal data sources.

Questions for us:

- What data sets can be correlated (by ID or modeling)?
- What questions can we answer by doing so?
- The Climate Policy Office is looking in this direction. Anyone else we can speak to?

Technical work:

- Comsume data
- Cross-walk

Other general, high-level questions:

- Who's using the dirtiest fuel?
- Who's the cleanest agency?
- Who's making the most progress?

## Acquisitions

Help decision makers make high-impact purchasing decisions.

Relevant potential data sources:

- [Federal Procurement Data System](./data-inventory.md#federal-procurement-data-system) includes historical purchasing information
- [Federal Energy Management Program](./data-inventory.md#federal-energy-management-program) may be used to compare agencies and visualize long-term trends

## Non-Governmental Organizations

Aid advocacy or other interest groups in understanding federal activity.

- How can I access raw datasets so I can perform my own analysis?
- What emissions activities are performed in my community?

## Industry

- What agencies may I sell my green products to?
- What is the size of government markets with high emission levels?
