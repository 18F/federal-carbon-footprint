# Visualizing the Federal Carbon Footprint

Funded by [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/), this repository is home to the [Visualizing the Federal Carbon Footprint](https://trello.com/c/1N9dESH2/162-visualizing-the-federal-carbon-footprint) project.

Currently in [phase two (discovery)](https://10x.gsa.gov/process/), we are focused on exploring this idea:

> We have observed that the federal government emits huge amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) every year, including more than 37 million tons from federal facility operations in 2019 alone. The public lacks a window into how federal agencies are doing their part to reduce the effects of climate change. 10x will investigate how user-centered design and savvy data analysis could create a clear picture of the governmentâ€™s efforts to kick its carbon habit, resulting in more transparency and accountability and ensuring that we, as civil servants, are doing our best to reduce the impact of climate change on our country.

This repository consists of two components: on-going documentation of our findings, and a prototype codebase that we are developing for exploratory purposes.

## Progress

We are tracking the work for the on-going Phase Two on our [project board](https://github.com/18F/federal-carbon-footprint/projects/1).

## Findings

- [Data sources](./docs/data-inventory.md)
- [Potential use cases](./docs/use-cases.md)

## Developer documentation

[Architectural Decision Records](./docs/adr) of core design decisions are maintained.

Developer documentation is available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
